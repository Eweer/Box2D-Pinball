## Description

Config file can be found in Output/config.xml. Collider information can be found in Output/Assets/Textures/level_1/colliders.xml

Hitting any of the four "dividers" fills a bit of the circle. When it's full, it gives you bonus points, and a x2 point multiplier while "POWER!!!" text is blinking.
